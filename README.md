# Socket_prog_video_conferencing
This is a video conferencing ,audio and file transfer  project made by using socket programming in python 

1.socket library in python and Tkinter for gui are used to implement our project 
2.There are 2 Files Server and client.
=>steps to run the project 
1.First run the server by connecting to some network and note its ip and port number
2.then we can run multiple clients and connect to server with same ip and port number so that socket connection will be established on both sides.
3.This project supports only upto 2 clients for video conferencing whereas we can remove this restriction by commenting out the video related parts and can 
involve multiple clients for text and file transfer.
4.At the end disconnect the clients from server so that program terminates
